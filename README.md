## What is Brendapyrser?
This project provides python classes and functions to parse the text file containing the entire BRENDA enzyme database (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org)

This is an ongoing project!

## Installation
1. ```pip install brendapyrser```

or

2. Git clone project to local directory.

   In terminal navigate to directory and enter: ```python setup.py install```

## Usage

Due to BRENDA's license, BRENDA's database cannot be downloaded directly by the parser, instead, the user is asked to download the database as a text file after accepting usage conditions [here](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/download.php).

You can find a jupyter notebook with usage examples [here](docs/examples.ipynb).
