    abstract = "{The BRENDA enzyme database (www.brenda-enzymes.org), recently appointed ELIXIR Core Data Resource, is the main enzyme and enzyme-ligand information system. The core database provides a comprehensive overview on enzymes. A collection of 4.3 million data for ∼84 000 enzymes manually evaluated and extracted from ∼140 000 primary literature references is combined with information obtained by text and data mining, data integration and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, predicted enzyme locations and genome annotations. Major developments are a revised ligand summary page and the structure search now including a similarity and isomer search. BKMS-react, an integrated database containing known enzyme-catalyzed reactions, is supplemented with further reactions and improved access to pathway connections. In addition to existing enzyme word maps with graphical information of enzyme specific terms, plant word maps have been developed. They show a graphical overview of terms, e.g. enzyme or plant pathogen information, connected to specific plants. An organism summary page showing all relevant information, e.g. taxonomy and synonyms linked to enzyme data, was implemented. Based on a decision by the IUBMB enzyme task force the enzyme class EC 7 has been established for ‘translocases’, enzymes that catalyze a transport of ions or metabolites across cellular membranes.}",
