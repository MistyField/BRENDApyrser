# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
<!-- ![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png) -->
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
<!-- ![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
